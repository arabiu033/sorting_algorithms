# 0x1B C - Sorting algorithms & Big O :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of sorting algoritms.

At the end of this project, I was able to achieve:
  
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
1. Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
2. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
3. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
